Installing drivers for build-in ATB-USBasp programmer

If you haven't had previously installed USBasp drivers in your system, then thanks to
MkAvrCalculator software you just need to connect ATB-module to PC and enjoy fully automated installation
of digitally signed drivers.If while connecting the module to PC MkAvrCalculator software wasn't running
then Windows will notify you about newly discovered USB hardware. Drawback here is that device will show as missing
appropiate drivers.
