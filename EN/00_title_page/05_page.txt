First run - testing the board

In this chapter we will discuss all recommended steps allowing you to properly
test primary components of the ATB board


MkAvrCalculator software - license

For performing operations on microcontroller i.e. reading , programming , checking proper
behavior you should always use up to date MkAvrCalculator software which can be
downloaded from http://atnel.pl/mkavrcalculator.html. Once downloaded unpack it to destination folder
of your choice.By default after download program runs in FREE/DEMO mode.
Everyone who bought ATB board receives by email license file ( lic.dat ) for
MkAvrCalculator software. In order to activate that license - place that file in folder
which contains application. Once that is done and program is restarted it will be running in FULL version mode which allows
to interact with ever AVR microcontroller including Atmega32 shipped with ATB board.

Before further interacting with the board software should be installed on computer which
will allow for fully automated installation of digitally signed drivers for build
in USBasp programmer
