[ J15 ] - position RW->uC, RW pin of LCD connected to MCU
position RW->GND *, pin RW of LCD connected to GND

[ J8 ] - closed *, ATB-microSD module need to be closed
open, for other modules using ATB-Microport connect accordingly to manual

Remaining white jumpers on PCB we use accordingly to description provided on the board.
Two under L293D [ J39 ] and [ J40 ] are used to permanent power on of EN input for the IC and PWM = 100%.
Jumpers can be taken out and connected to single pins of MCU to control independently with each of bridges with use of PWM

Additionaly one of white jumpers allows to select I2C address for externaly mounted EEPROM memory IC (24c04)

USB jumpers ( 2mm ) - related to configuration of one from USB-HUB.

[ J11 J12 J13 J14 ]
Jumpers allows for the following to be configured:
1. USBasp - default configuration *
Remaining options implies disconnection of USBasp
2. USB - clean lines D+ and D- on ??? J17
3. V-USB - ready for connection to J17 ( table with description on PCB  )


(wildcard) * - indicates default setting when leaving the factory.
