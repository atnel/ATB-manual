Reading BLS - first test for proper working of microcontroller

Every Atmega32 microcontroller shipped with ATB-module by Atnel corporation
has altered fuse settings responsible for placement of bootloader in flash and
it's automated start after reset.Bootloader is installed for you.

Steps to test the ATB-module
In order to verify proper operations of microcontroller as well as USB/RS232 converter
you just need to execute following actions:
1.	Connect ATB module to computer with USB cable.
2.	Set J2 PWR jumper in USB position.
3.	Check if jumpers [ JP6 ]   and  [ JP7 ] are installed ( positioned just above microcontroller)
4.	Start MkBootloader software.
5.	Set MkBootloader to work in RS232 mode.
6.	Change baudrate transmission speed setting to 115200
7.	Choose appropiate COM port (displayed by MkAvrCAlculator software).
8.	Push info button.
