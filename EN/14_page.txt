[ Zworki �ӣTE ] - responsible for data plane: RS232 oraz I2C

RS232 Bus

JP6 - closed *, TX processor line connected to RX line of FT232R
open, TX processor line disconnected from RX line of FT232R

JP7 - closed *, RX processor line connected to TX line of FT232R
open, RX processor line disconnected from TX line of FT232R

WARNING: Jumpers are closed by default which means you cannot connect external devices
i.e. Bluetooth/Wifi to pins PD0/PD1 of MCU. Same you cannot use the for other purposes.
In order to perform safely he above you need to open both Jumpers.
