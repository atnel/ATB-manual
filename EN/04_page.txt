Options for powering ATB board

Every ATB base version board with ATB-PWR3 step down regulator installed can be
powered from one of the three following sources:
1. Type A-B USB cable (printer type) connected to PC ( default power mode )
2. External power source of 12V with use of ATB-PWR3 step down regulator
3. External KANDA tape - power from the programmer

The source is selected by using J2 PWR jumper allowing to switch between USB and EXT.By default
USB is selected as source.

In case of use ATB-LION (providing buffered power) and lack of external power - its possible to use
Li-Ion batteries and LiPO.You can also us it without use of batteries by just connecting
external charger to micro USB port (i.e. from mobile device or to USB port in PC)
